PROXY FUNCTIONS
================

-Login: to connect to the API
	this connection will be anonymous as we only need readonly access

-Get git projects

-Get git repos
	//the repos are part of the project

-Exporting to JSON
-Filtering the JSON
	//We noticed that some repos are replicated
	//We have to filter that so we dont have duplicates
	//We can fitler on the GitIdentity or UniqueName of the project because all 
	//of them have the same ID.
	//Use a dictionary?
	//Filter on unique name? It's at least as unique as the ID if not more.
