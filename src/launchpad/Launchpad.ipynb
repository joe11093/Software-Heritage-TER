Over 40 editing functions include scaling, cropping, quantization and dithering, colorizing and uncolorizing, blurring, and dimming. Netpbm programs are often invoked by other programs, for example in CGI scripts that manage web site graphics. It also includes a C function library which helps you write programs to process graphics at a lower level than the Netpbm utilities.\n",
