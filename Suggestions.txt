1)
https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-lister/tutorial.html#lister-tutorial

parts 3 and 4 references the "request in (1)" but (1) is a variable declaration. Should it reference 2?


2) Do a Loader for Bazaar? (or other popular alternatives)
	This would also allow us to write tutorial for how to create a loader.	
	We already have the sequence diagram which might help us to create a loader.
	We will need to look up the loader code and understand how it works.

3) Ligne de produits? (we dont like this suggestion much)

4) Create another Lister?
