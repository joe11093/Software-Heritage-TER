BU Fac des sciences

We started at 10:30.
The first part was for installation. We installed the production mode of SWH on Bachar's machine, w developer mode on Joseph and Bachar's machine. We installed the dependcies on Tasnim's machine.

Then, we started talking about the listers and the tutorial. We are reading the lister code, seeing what functions need to be implemented, which base to use for the lister.

"covered for now in the codeâ€™s docstring comments"
If we find enough information in the docstring, maybe we can transform them into documentation.

We found the Bitbucket model of the repos object response.

We went through the bitbucket and github listers, and compared them to the models. We also looked at the rate limits for bitbucket and github.
We found that the base URL value must be defined in the "tasks" file while instantiating our lister. This instanciation will call the __init__ of the parent Lister and pass it this Parameter (api_baseurl) with the correct value as default value. This base url, completed with the PATH_TEMPLATE url and a value "foo" will give us a complete url to make a API request.

We understood the flow of the program from the sequence diagram, and from the chain of function calls in the Github lister code and the classes it inherits from. 

We are trying to find the model of SourceForge.
We need to check if SourceForge respects (he IETF standard for communicating rate limits with HTTP code 429 ) [https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-lister/tutorial.html#lister-tutorial] since not all hosting services choose to respect them.

We need to find what format SourceForge's responses are in. JSON like Github and Bitbucket? Something else?

19:09
We spent the day searching the APIs of SourceForge and Launchpad. We are so far not able to find any way to obtain all the repos.
We sent an email to Jessy to ask her if we could contact the SWH team.
We sent an email to SourceForge's support (sfnet_ops@slashdotmedia.com) to ask for help regarding the API.
