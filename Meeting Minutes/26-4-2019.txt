Meeting in the BU

Bachar, Joseph, Tasnim

We started our day by running code. 
The python code connects to the Launchpad servers via its client, gets all projects and puts them in a file. 
Then we are able to get all git projects by looping over and filtering this list.
We were able to access the attributes of the projects.

Since we don't really have an API to query other than by using the Launchpad client, we decided to dump the projects we get into a JSON.
We will create a proxy class.
This proxy class will contain the Lauchpad client object. Its job will be to handle all operations around the client object. 
It will be able to fetch projects, filter the git ones, get their repos.
It will also contain functions that are meant to import and export the json.
It will build an index that contains the GIT repos of launchpad, which will be indexed by their IDs.
This index is what will be accessible to the lister and its what the Lister will query instead of querying an API.

We looked into the resulting JSON and were able to map the repo model to the model required by SWH. 
We also created the model of the Proxy class.

Once the lister and the proxy class are created, we will be able to use them together. 

Tasnim: Will learn about how to test the code we will write.
Bachar: Will write the proxy class
Joseph: Will write the lister.

We also installed some things we needed (SWH repo to obtain all their code).

Primary versions of lister and proxy class were created and some testing was prepared.
