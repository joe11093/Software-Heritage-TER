At LIRRM


We explained the documents we read to each other.
We discussed the documents.
We decided 

	1- Installing Docker (read the SH documentation)
	2- Installing Installing Software Heritage
	3- Read the documentation of the GitHub listers and the Bitbucket lister

We decided to do the Lister of SourceForge.

We talked about possibilities for an extension of our TER.
	a. Lignes de Produits
	b. Full and incremental Lister
	c. Doing a loader for Bazaar and then doing a Lister for a forge that uses Bazaar (Launchpad)
	d. Think of possible additional contextual information that can be added
	e. Full code indexing and full-text search
