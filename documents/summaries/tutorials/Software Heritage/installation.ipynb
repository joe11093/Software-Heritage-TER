    "## Introduction\n",
    "1. **software stack**:\n",
    "    - stack:\n",
    "        1. **front-end components**\n",
    "        1. **back-end workers**\n",
    "        1. **database components**\n",
    "        1. **environment and library dependencies**\n",
    "    - these components can differ *greatly* on **different platforms**\n",
    "1. **need**: make sure that a code running in a **development environment** works in a **testing environment as well** (*i.e. insuring portability of code during software deployment on every possible platform*)\n",
    "1. **definition**:\n",
    "    - `Docker` is a **software container platform**: *i.e.* a software that performs **operating-system level virtualization** called \"**containerization**\" at the **deployment stage of a software**\n",
    "    - it allows a developer to **package up an application with all its dependencies** (*tools, libraries, configuration files, etc.*) in a **single package** (*bundle*) called a `container` and **abstracts** from him its **portability insuring details** (*i.e. shipping details*)\n",
    "    - **containers** are **isolated** from each other and communicate via **well-defined channels**\n",
    "1. **workflow**:\n",
    "    - `dockerfile`: a developer will define the **application and its dependencies and requirements** in a file called a **dockerfile**\n",
    "    - `docker images`:\n",
    "        1. a **dockerfile** describes **steps to create a Docker image**\n",
    "        1. **Docker images** are **templates** (*containing all the dependencies and requirements of the application*) used to create `docker containers`\n",
    "        1. they can be stored in **online cloud repositories** called \"`Docker registries`\" (*e.g.* ***Dock Hub***) and can be **pulled** to create **containers in any environment** (*e.g. test environment, staging environment, etc.*)\n",
    "    - `docker containers`: **docker containers** are the **runtime instances** of a **Docker image**\n",
    "1. **containerization vs. virtualization**:\n",
    "    - **virtualization**:\n",
    "        1. a **hypervisor** (*software*) is used to **create and run multiple virtual machines** (*i.e.* ***guest OSs***) on a **host OS**\n",
    "        1. the **virtual machines** have **their own OS and do not use the host OS** -> they are run by **multiple OS kernels** -> **overhead** on the **host platform**\n",
    "        1. **resource allocation** is **fixed** and does not change as per application needs\n",
    "    - **containerization**:\n",
    "        1. a **container engine** (*software*) is used to **create and run containers** (*i.e.* ***an application and all its dependencies***)\n",
    "        1. the **containers** use the **host OS** -> they are run by **a single OS kernel**\n",
    "        1. **resource allocation** is **dynamic as per application needs**\n",
    "        1. a **docker container** could be **run within a virtual machine** (*i.e. on the virtual machine's OS*)\n",
    "        1. **less overhead**, more lightweight and **faster than virtual machines**\n",
    "1. **advantages**:\n",
    "    - **portability of code** on different platforms during **deployment**\n",
    "    - **pushing/pulling docker images** from **docker registries** and using them in **different environments**\n",
    "    - **built-in VCS** similar to `git` : **commit messages**\n",
    "    - **container isolation**:\n",
    "        1. **no interference** with applications running on the **same OS**\n",
    "        1. **multiple containers** can be **executed simultaneously on the same OS**\n",
    "    - **clean container purging**: **deleting a container deletes also all of its dependencies and requirements along**\n",
    "1. **architecture**: a **client-server architecture**:\n",
    "    - **client**: **CLI**\n",
    "    - **server**:\n",
    "        1. a `Docker daemon` **containing all the containers**\n",
    "        1. can be on the **same machine** as that of the **client** or on a **different one**\n",
    "        1. can **interact** with a **Docker Registry**\n",
    "    - **interaction**: **client** -> **CLI commands** or **REST API requests** -> **server**\n",
    "    - **actions**:\n",
    "        1. **build a Docker image from a dockerfile**\n",
    "        1. **run a docker container from a Docker image**\n",
    "        1. **pull/push a Docker image from/to a Docker registry**\n",
    "    - `Docker engine` = **client + server + their components**\n",
